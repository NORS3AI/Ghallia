# Ghallia - Idle/Active Prestige Crafting Game

## Overview

Ghallia is a **hybrid idle/active game** inspired by Old School RuneScape (OSRS) and World of Warcraft's profession systems. Players grind skills to craft items, armor, and bags to sell for gold, reinvesting earnings to further their progression. The core loop revolves around skill leveling, crafting, and a prestige system that resets progress in exchange for powerful permanent upgrades.

**Active vs Idle:**
- **Gathering Skills** = Active (click/tap to gather resources)
- **Crafting Skills** = Idle (queue items, they craft over time)

## Core Game Loop

2. **Save Gold** - Sell raw materials or save for skill unlocks
3. **Unlock Sawmill** - First purchase (1,000g) to process wood into sellable goods
4. **Expand Skills** - Buy more gathering/crafting skills (10,000g+)
5. **Craft & Sell** - Queue crafting jobs, sell for profit
6. **Prestige** - Once 5 skills reach level 99, prestige for Chaos Points
7. **Unlock Support Skills** - After Prestige 1, access powerful passive bonuses
